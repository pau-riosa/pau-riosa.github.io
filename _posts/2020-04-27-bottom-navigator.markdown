### Bottom Navigator

so yeah another exciting **MOBILE TODAY** happened tonight and I've finally worked on my first
**BOTTOM NAVIGATOR** (ooooooohhhh he's on ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥) haha! just kidding.
got research on some tricks on how to add a custom button in the middle of navigator and I was like. Holy Macaroni! It worked!


### How did you do that?

what I did on this was I use the `v5` of [react-navigation](https://reactnavigation.org/) you can check out their docs so you could get more information on how to use it. And specifically, use the `@react-navigation/bottom-tabs`.

[see gist for more details](https://gist.github.com/pau-riosa/02266a3e862d34eff33608fd3b7c9477)

### So what's the next plan?

hmm, maybe I'll try work on adding a floating button that when you clicked the button it will show you some option buttons (yeah full of button!) 
or maybe add a modal that will pop-up a new form! I don't know, there is a lot of ideas coming out and I just need to plan and execute it as much as possible.

### Take Note! 

I hope you find It helpful, **but take note! It is just the BOTTOM NAVIGATOR**, you need to create your **MAIN NAVIGATOR** and include it as a **STACK SCREEN**! HURRAH!
