### Bottom Navigator

so yeah another exciting happened tonight and I've finally worked on my first
**BOTTOM NAVIGATOR** (ooooooohhhh he's on ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥) haha! just kidding.
got research on some tricks on how to add a custom button in the middle of navigator and I was like. Holy Macaroni! It worked!


### How did you do that?

what I did on this was, I use the `v5` of [react-navigation](https://reactnavigation.org/) you can out their docs so you could get more information on how to use it. And specifically, use the `@react-nativigation/bottom-tabs`. Again, see their documentation! Then I started to playaround with the it.

[see gist for more details](https://gist.github.com/pau-riosa/02266a3e862d34eff33608fd3b7c9477)

### So what's the next plan?

hmm, maybe I'll try work on adding a floating button that when you clicked the button it will show you some option buttons!

### Take Note! 

I hope you find It helpful, **but take note! It is just the BOTTOM NAVIGATOR**, you need to create your **MAIN NAVIGATOR** and include it as a stack screen! HURRAH!
