### Resilient
> ...get that motivation to not give up and not be a quitter, no matter how bad you want to just fall flat on your face and collapse - Eminem 

Through tough times and trials, nothing beats a person with determination 
and perseverance. Everyday is a challenge and an obstacle to overcome. Keep
grinding and pushing your limits that even in difficult situations you know
that you can! You know that you will! You know that you can succeed!

### Faithful
> Even the best fall down sometimes - Howie Day

Be faithful to your dreams! Trust in your instinct and manage to persuade yourself that you have something to achieve. Think about the failures that you have been through. As the song says, 
You are the only one whose gonna believe that you can!

### Humble
> Sit down, be humble! - Kendrick Lamar

No matter what things you have achieved always think and remind yourself that
being humble is the most important part of life. Don't you ever look 
unto someone like they are a failure. Always open your mind wide open that you
are not a perfect being. You also gone through failures and you know what it feels on
the ground.


### Finish what you have started!
> We are the champions - Queen

Don't ever tell to yourself that you can't! Find a way on chasing those dreams. Dont't ever quit. Just do it even if hurts. Just keep grinding. At the end, those who never quit prevails.
