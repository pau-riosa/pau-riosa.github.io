### What I am up to?

Few days ago, I was scrolling around on a social networking site and got to see a post 
that there will be a little 'Science Fair' of different web, mobile etc. stuffs wherein you can
build you're apps during this quarantine season. ( please visit [code-with-friend](https://scottkwang.github.io/CodeWithFriends-Spring2020/). ) 


### So what did I felt about it?

Because of that, I got little bit excited yet nervous. Excited because it will take me to a brand new level
of making apps (which is mobile application development), and nervous because I don't know where to start!

### What makes me decided to join this one ?

It gives me a desire to build my own app someday. I want to try new things and stay out of my comfort zone.
Everyday, a brand new beginning approach us. The important thing is your **decision** if you're going to catch it or let it slip.

### My starting point ðŸ”¥

So right now, I started my first react-native project and it's kind a awesome. Just this weekend, 
I just learned how to use some navigations, inputs, button, and even styling! (which is not my forte). But what 
I'd like about is that, I got to learn new ideas, tricks and AWESOMENESS!

I am thankful that I got something to look from starting this week!
