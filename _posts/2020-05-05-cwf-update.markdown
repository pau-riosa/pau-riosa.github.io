### What am I doing?

Okay! a few days ago, I started to think of an idea for CWF Project. What I decided was to create an appointment app for my dentist friend.

### What are your updates?

So I started to criticize my own mock up and get some feedbacks from my friends. As a first timer creating mock ups, it is a bit hard
because I already thinking about coding it. But what I learned was first I need to think about the user experience itself.

1. Are my user really gonna use it?
2. Are they gonna be interested to what I will build?
3. How could I keep it small but still deliver the main concept of making an appointment? 

So in order to do that, I need to forget my "inner coding self" and start creating the idea.

### What did you do?

So I started to refactor and create some changes. I started to think what will be the main key features that can be built within a month. So here it is.

### What will be the next step?

So I already agree to myself that this is the final concept that I want to build. So possibly, I will start coding now! Ohhhh yeah!
