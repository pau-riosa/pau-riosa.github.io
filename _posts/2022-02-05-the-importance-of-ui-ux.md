### Intro

For the past couple of days, I have been juggling down different
ideas that can add more value to my skills and personal self. I have been
coding a lot and thinking about projects that I can do to practice those skills I need.

But for one time, I found this [youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9Wg6Cb_YlU) and surprisingly it tells about `UI/UX Design Tutorial`. I tried to
internalize things when I saw the thumbnail and here I go! I click it! Didn't know that I am watching it already and enjoying the process.

Here are my personal key take aways that I think can help add value to my/our/your skills! ðŸš€ as a backend engineer!

### Think before you code!

A lot of times when I have an idea (even today) I started to code it directly.
I thought that it was right and I am in the right track but then again I ended up
struggling.

Struggling to get the output that I want because I did not think about `what feature should I code`.
So I ended up going from scratch again. Felt stuck and keep on re-coding the things I already coded.
I felt a never ending coding process and ended up being burned out because I did not think first what feature or idea I should do.

### Do it from scratch!

This is something that literally means doing the things from scratch.

It is more of...

> writing or drawing those thoughts inside your mind.

Let say you already have the idea. The second thing I learned was to take down notes or
draw those things to visualize the idea. In this case, using `wireframes`

Wireframes helps me realize that...

> thinking is not enough when it comes to building projects.

You should use your pens or papers to visualize that gold idea.

### Nice and slowly

Honestly, I do not have any enough experience doing wireframes, UI Layout or Mockups.
But when I watched the video, I realize that it is easy as counting 1, 2, 3!

But you should pay attention to the elements you are adding. Just do it `Nice and Slowly`
Understand why you are adding these elements. Think about what things would help build
that idea.

Start small. Do not over complicate things. Consider thinking about a working prototype design
that can help you deliver in no time.

### Realization

Adding UI/UX designing makes me realize that I can do so much if I start right.
Having the idea in my mind to be put on a piece of paper first makes me think that surely, I can
really picture out what I really want to build.
